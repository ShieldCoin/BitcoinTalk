[center][size=10pt][font=Century]SHIELD is a new privacy and speed focused cryptocurrency. It isn't an ICO or preminend. SHIELD will be POW for around the first year. We're working on a PoS system that is fair for all and won't have a gigantic inflation, to give our coin a real future.[/font][/size][/center]

[center][size=12pt][font=Century]SHIELD is for people that value their time and identity. SHIELD also is future proof as it has multi-algo mining and has POS on it's way to lower the cost of maintaining the coin. SHIELD also has a low fee rate and will be quantum proof within a year. You can easily use SHIELD with its upcoming Electrum wallets. SHIELD will also change the face of P2P payments as we're going to integrate in almost any social media. More information can be found on the about page of our website [url=https://shieldcoin.github.io/About/]Here[/url]. 

In short: 

PoS Boo: In the future we'll be implementing PoS Boo to SHIELD, this is based on PoS Casper but with some tweaks to make it more ano friendly. 
SHIELD Protocol: Our quantum proof system where we use Lamport Signatures to sign blocks instead of ECDSA, making them very resistant to quantum computers 
More in-depth information about the features of the coin will be discussed in the whitepaper that is coming as soon as possible[/size][/center]
